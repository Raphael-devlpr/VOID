## 📈 KEYWORD STRATEGY (What People Actually Search)

### High-Value Keywords You Should Rank For:
1. **"web developer [your city]"** - e.g., "web developer Pretoria"
2. **"affordable website design South Africa"**
3. **"e-commerce developer Gauteng"**
4. **"mobile app development Johannesburg"**
5. **"IT support services near me"**

7. **"WordPress developer Pretoria"**
8. **"Point of Sale software South Africa"**
9. **"API integration services"**
10. **"SEO services Gauteng"**

### Action: Create Blog Posts for Each Service

- "How Much Does a Website Cost in South Africa? [Complete Guide]"
- "E-commerce vs Marketplace: Which is Right for Your Business?"
- "5 Signs Your Business Needs a Custom POS System"
- "API Integration: How to Connect Your Business Systems"

**Publish 1-2 blog posts per month** targeting these keywords.

---

## 💰 HOW TO GET MORE CLIENTS

### 1. Portfolio & Case Studies (Critical!)
Your site shows projects - make them more detailed:

**For each project, add:**
- Client testimonial/quote
- The problem they had
- How you solved it
- Results (e.g., "Increased sales by 40%")
- Technologies used
- Timeline and budget range

**Action:** Contact your existing clients for testimonials!

---

### 2. Social Proof
Add these to your homepage:
- ✅ "Trusted by 50+ South African businesses"
- ✅ Display client logos (you already have some)
- ✅ Show live project count
- ✅ Customer reviews/ratings
- ✅ "Projects completed this month"

---

### 3. Lead Magnets (Free Value)
Offer something free to collect emails:
- "Free Website Audit"
- "Free 30-Min Consultation"
- "Free SEO Checklist for Small Businesses"
- "Website Cost Calculator"
- "E-commerce Setup Guide"

**Action:** Add a popup or banner offering a free consultation

---

### 4. Social Media Marketing

**LinkedIn** (Best for B2B clients):
- Post your projects weekly
- Share industry tips
- Connect with business owners
- Use hashtags: #WebDevelopmentSA #GautengBusiness #SABusinessOwners

**Facebook**:
- Create a business page

- Share tips and completed projects
- Run targeted ads (R500-R1000/month)

**Instagram**:

---

### 5. Run Google Ads (Small Budget)
Start with R50-R100/day targeting:
- "website developer [city]"
- "need a website south africa"
- "e-commerce developer"

**Why?** While SEO builds up (3-6 months), ads get immediate clients.

---

### 6. Networking & Partnerships
- Join local business chambers
- Attend networking events
- Partner with marketing agencies (who don't do web dev)
- Offer referral commissions
- Cold email small businesses without websites

---
